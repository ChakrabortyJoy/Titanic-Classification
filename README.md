# Titanic-Classification
Harness machine learning to predict Titanic passenger survival based on passenger attributes.

Sure, here is an example of a README file for GitHub on the project entitled Titanic classification:

# Titanic Classification

This project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The project compares the performance of different classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier, LightGBM classifier, and CatBoost classifier.

## Project Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 remains one of the deadliest maritime disasters in history. While the ship was considered state-of-the-art, a combination of factors led to its tragic fate. One of the most intriguing aspects of this event is the varying survival rates among passengers.

This project seeks to explore the factors that influenced passenger survival using machine learning techniques. By analyzing passenger data, including age, gender, class, and travel companions, the project aims to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a passenger would have survived the disaster.

## Data Preparation

The project utilized the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information on 891 passengers, including their age, gender, class, embarkation port, and whether they survived the sinking.

Before applying machine learning algorithms, the data underwent preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features. This involved imputing missing values using appropriate methods, removing outliers, and encoding categorical features into numerical representations.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Six different classification algorithms were employed to predict passenger survival: logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier, LightGBM classifier, and CatBoost classifier.

Each model was trained and evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. This technique divides the data into 10 folds, trains the model on 9 folds, and evaluates its performance on the remaining fold. This process is repeated 10 times, providing a more robust assessment of the model's generalizability.

## Results

The LightGBM classifier emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 85.2%. This means that the model correctly predicted whether a passenger survived the sinking 85.2% of the time.

The following table summarizes the accuracy scores of each model:

| Model | Accuracy Score |
|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 80.72% |
| Decision Tree Classifier | 72.19% |
| Random Forest Classifier | 78.92% |
| XGBoost Classifier | 78.45% |
| CatBoost Classifier | 82.96% |

## Insights

The results of this project highlight the potential of machine learning in uncovering patterns and relationships within data. By analyzing passenger characteristics, the LightGBM classifier was able to accurately predict survival outcomes with remarkable accuracy.

Further exploration of the LightGBM model's feature importance revealed that factors such as age, gender, and class played a significant role in determining survival. This aligns with historical accounts of the disaster, which indicated that children and women from higher social classes had a higher chance of survival.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. The LightGBM classifier proved to be a powerful tool for analyzing passenger data and making accurate predictions. The insights gained from this project provide valuable historical context and enhance our understanding of the factors that influenced survival during this tragic event.

## Future Directions

Future work on this project may include:

* **Exploring additional features that could influence survival, such as travel companions, occupation, and prior travel experience.**

* **Investigating the use of ensemble methods, which combine multiple models to improve overall prediction accuracy.**

* **Developing a web application or user interface to make the survival prediction model accessible to a wider audience.**
